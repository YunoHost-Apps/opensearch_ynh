OpenSearch makes it easy to ingest, search, visualize, and analyze your data.

### Features

OpenSearch is a scalable, flexible, and extensible open-source software suite for search, analytics, and observability applications licensed under Apache 2.0. Powered by Apache Lucene and driven by the OpenSearch Project community, OpenSearch offers a vendor-agnostic toolset you can use to build secure, high-performance, cost-efficient applications. Use OpenSearch as an end-to-end solution or connect it with your preferred open-source tools or partner projects.

### Limitations

- Currently the security is disabled
- Therefore, the package is configured to remain not public for now (i.e. not accessible through the web, the apps depending on it should be installed on the same server)
- Not scalable for now
